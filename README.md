# AR-SpacePortal
This lens was created for Snapchat's Augmented Reality Lensathon
This Snapchat lens is a portal effect that takes the user to space !
During the pandemic, being stuck at home gave me this opportunity to learn a new tech- Augmented Reality. With AR anything is possible !
AR Portals have always fascinated me for the fact that they give the user an experience of augmenting virtual objects to their own environment and giving an experience of going into a virtual environment at the same time.

Feel free to use my project to create amazing effects.
To use this project, follow the steps:
1. Download Lens Studio - It doesn't work with any other platform!
2. Download the files in the repo
3. Open the file with '.lsproj' extension
4. There you go ! Do give me a credit whenever you use it for your projects ;)
